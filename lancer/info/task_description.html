... the vampires fought fiercely. Judging by the course of the battle, Sir Ronald made the right decision, although not very ethically ambiguous. <br>
Suddenly, new soldiers joined the Umbert’s ranks - has he really got an ace up his sleeve? Lancers presented the fresh forces, which made Sir Ronald’s position increasingly difficult, lancers could attack two soldiers at once with their long spears. Something needed to be done with that…

It seems that Warrior, Knight, Defender and Vampire are not enough to win the battle. Let's add one more powerful unit type - Lancer.<br>
Lancer should be the subclass of the Warrior and should attack with the specific way - when he hit the other unit, he also deal a 50% of the dealed damage to the enemy unit, who stands behind the first unit, which was attacked by the Lancer (enemy defense make dealed damage value lower - consider this).<br>
The basic parameters of the Lancer:<br>
health = 50<br>
attack = 6<br>
