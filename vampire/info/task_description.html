The flocks of crows circled over the battlefield. Many brave warriors have fallen in this battle, many have continued to fight. <br>
"If this goes on, we’ll simply kill each other, and there will be no winners - we’ll all lose." - reflected Sir Ronald, watching a bleak picture in front of him. <br>
"I have to make an important decision. I know what it’ll cost, but now that’s the only thing that can save us all..." <br>
A long time ago, when he was often in search of trouble and adventure, he went to hunt a witch who had  a huge bounty on her head. The bloody creature was able to save her life by persuading the knight to take a gift from her - a vial of vampire blood. This blood poured into the dying man’s mouth could bring him back to life in vampire form.<br>
Is it really the day when he has to use it?.. <br>
It seemed to be the only way to win this battle. <br>
Sir Ronald began to lean over the barely living bodies of his knights, who were lying beside him. To each of them he said: <br>
- "Drink. You’ll be given a new life..."

<p>
So we have 3 types of units: the Warrior, Knight and Defender. Let's make the battles even more epic and add another type - the Vampire!<br>
Vampire should be the subclass of the Warrior class and have the additional <strong>vampirism</strong> parameter, which helps him to heal himself. When the Vampire hits the other unit, he restores his health by +50% of the dealt damage (enemy defense makes the dealt damage value lower).<br>
The basic parameters of the Vampire:<br>
health = 40<br>
attack = 4<br>
vampirism = 50%<br>
</p>

<p>
You should store vampirism attribute as an integer (50 for 50%). In the future, for weapons mission, we will assume it's an integer and we will test that.
